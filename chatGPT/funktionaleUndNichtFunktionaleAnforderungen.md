Functional requirements refer to what the IT infrastructure is supposed to do, while non-functional requirements refer to how well it is supposed to do it. Here are some examples of functional and non-functional requirements for IT infrastructure:

Functional Requirements:

    Support for multiple operating systems and platforms
    Compatibility with a range of hardware and software
    Ability to handle high volumes of traffic or data
    Fast and reliable performance
    Scalability for future growth or expansion
    Integration with other systems and applications
    Security features to protect against threats and attacks

Non-Functional Requirements:

    Availability: the system should be up and running as much as possible
    Reliability: the system should be able to perform consistently and without errors
    Performance: the system should perform fast and efficiently
    Usability: the system should be easy to use and navigate
    Maintainability: the system should be easy to maintain and update
    Scalability: the system should be able to grow and expand as needed
    Security: the system should be secure and protect against unauthorized access or data breaches.
